About me
====
Great Hi from China! I am a senior in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), Beijing, China. I am expected to get Bachelor of Science degree in 2026. Before entering university, I grew up and got my education in [Luanchuan County, Luoyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luanchuan_County), a beautiful place. My hometown was designated as [national-level poor county](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National-level_poor_county) by the Chinese government before 2019. Through ["Ziqiang Program"](https://join-tsinghua.edu.cn/gnxs/zqjh.htm), I entered Tsinghua University in 2022 sucessfully.

Majoring in mathematics and physics, I want to devote myself into astronomy. I have a broad interest in different fields of astronomy, from exoplanet to cosmology, from theory to observation. In detail, I have related research experience in microlensing(theory and observation, supervised by Prof. [Shude Mao](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/Shude-Mao.html)) as well as weak lensing(theory, supervised by Prof. [Henk Hoekstra](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/henk-hoekstra)). Now, I want to work on deep learning and combine it with the weak lensing work as the topic of my graduate thesis (will be supervised by Prof. [Yuan-sen Ting](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Yuansen+Ting&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)). For more details, see my CV section in header.

My first research project on microlensing has been [published](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae14f3) in AJ (received directly), revealing a 5~10% overestimation on microlensing planetary sensitivity caused by the ignorance of binary-lens degeneracy. This effect is necessary to be mitigated in next-generation [Earth 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06693) and [Roman](https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov) mission. 

I am now looking for a PhD position with focus on detection and characterization of exoplanets and weak lensing. I am always thinking of the intersection of different techniques or even different fields to explore innovative physical scenarios. With my background in physics, I want to combine physical theory, observation as well as data analysis to grow up as an independent scholar.



TAS
====
Tsinghua Astronomy Society(TAS) is an interest-club in Tsinghua University, with more than 2000 members including undergraduates and graduates. I was the scientific minister last year. The focus of this position is about popularization of science and scientific outreach. You can follow our WeChat channel "清华天协" (with 20k fans by now) to receive the notifications of our news, articles as well as activities.

Cosidering my background, I always face "first-generation challenge" when pursuing my ambition to be an astronomer. My way to handle this challenge is to participated in [scientific outreach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_outreach) to promote the public awareness of natural science. TAS is a great place where I can start my scientific outreach bussiness with a certain social influence. If you have ideas or plans about scientific outreach, please contact me freely!
