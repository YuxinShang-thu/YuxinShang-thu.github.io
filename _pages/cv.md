Education
======
* B.S. in Mathematics and Physics, Tsinghua University, 2026(expected)

Research experience
======
* Apr. 2024 ~ Sep. 2025: Scientific Researcher
  * Tsinghua University
  * Project: Binary-lens Microlensing Effect on Planetary Sensitivity and Mass-ratio Function
  * Duties includes: Organize research plan; Comprehensively simulate microlensing data analysis pipeline; Develop custom codes for data modeling to optimize accuracy–efficiency tradeoff
  * Supervisor: Prof. Shude Mao, Dr. Hongjing Yang

* Sep. 2025 ~ ongoing: Main Participant
  * Westlake University
  * Project: DREAMS -- DECam Rogue Earths And Mars Survey
  * Duties included: 6-Night observation using 4m Blance/DECam telescope in Chile (remote)
  * PI of DREAMS: Dr. Hongjing Yang, Dr. Weicheng Zang

* Sep. 2025 ~ ongoing: Scientific Researcher
  * Leiden University
  * Project: Explore Intrinsic Galaxy Alignment with Marked Correlation Function (utilizing numerical simulation FLAMINGO)
  * Duties included: Organize research plan; Develop custom pipeline for MCF measurement; Validation for FLAMINGO's samples
  * Supervisor: Prof. Henk Hoekstra, Dr. David Navarro, Dr. Divya Rana
  
Skills
======
* Skill 1 HPC: with experience in microlensing data modeling and in cosmology MCF computation, I am experienced in using HPC to conduct computation-intensive project.
* Skill 2 Data Modeling/Analysis: my research experience in microlensing especially trained me good at data modeling/analysis. I can skillfuly use MCMC/downhill algorithm and grid search method to finish high-dimensional data fitting.
* Skill 3 Deep learning: in ongoing project, I want to use deep learning to analyze the relationship between two physical properties in cosmological numerical simulation. Now I am learn to train and utilze deep learning model for astronomy.

Service and leadership
======
* Sep. 2024 ~ Sep. 2025: I was the Scientific Minister in Tsinghua Astronomy Society(TAS) last year. My duties included
  * Organizing regular seminars and public science lectures of Tsinghua Astronomy Society. Since last year, we have been collaborating with Tsinghua Alumni Society in Boston to give public lectures together.
  * Administering and reviewing the publication of public science articles on the official Wechat channel of Tsinghua
Astronomy Society. By now, our Wechat channel has more than 20k followers.
  * Maintaining the regular activities of Tsinghua Astronomy Society, including sidewalk astronomy, telescope
management, astronomical photography exhibition, etc.
