Invited by [Tsinghua Xuetang Talents Program](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/Admissions/Undergraduate/Tsinghua_Xuetang_Talents_Program.htm), I gave a presentaion to share my research experience in microlensing. I introduced the basic idea of microlensing technique, and then shared my research process. Finally, I introduced an fascinating microlensing scenario -- a [common envelop](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=common+envelop&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) structure. Although the probability of detection is rather slow, this plain physical scenario is worth to study and explore. See my slides [here](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/50f56586c110441fb8e6/).
