Resonance usually means stable in planetary dynamics. However, I found an interesting phenomenon in our Solar System. In [Kuiper belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt), resonant orbits are crowded with objects. However, in the [asteroid belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt), there are so-called "[kirkwood gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap)", which are unstable and rarely host objects. This contradictory fact made me explore the truth of both belts. Finally, I found that kirkwood gaps are special because they are actually the overlap resonant orbits of both Mars and Jupiter, making them unstable. I wrote a report in this course and you can read it [here](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/3ee747efa14249e892e4/).
