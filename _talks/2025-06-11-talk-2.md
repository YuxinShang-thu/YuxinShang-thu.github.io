As the final project of this graduate course, my presentation focused on an interesting exoplanet TOI-544b, which was regarded as a [potential water-world](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14908) with a radius coincidentally located in the so-called "[radius valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_planet_radius_gap)". Detailed observation of its atmosphere can help to judge potential mechanisms of the formation of "radius valley". An interesting question we met when preparing this presentation is that we found in [NASA website](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/toi-544-b/), the inclination of TOI-544b makes it unable to transit, althought this exoplanet was found by transit method/TESS. See the slides [here](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/98b2f491ea9441fcb8fd/).
